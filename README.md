# Mock Shapes

This is a simple library that generates random 2D shapes. It can be used to test 2D geometric
applications, or to draw images, or whatever you need.

Its original purpose was to provide data for a geometric application, and so far that is its only
use case. Consider this alpha software.

Bug reports and PRs are welcome.
